# BP DC26 Cotcha Standalone Badge Tutorial

So you got a DC26 Dev board and don't have any ideas on how to use it?  Why not take the AWESOME
[SecKC Cotcha](https://github.com/hevnsnt/cotcha) project designed by @hevnsnt and make it a wearable badge!

## Getting started

For this project you will need:

```
* 1x Cotcha (Wemos D1, Lipo Charger and 1s Lipo battery)
* Bits of wire (solid core recommended)
* Button (optional but recommended)
* Header pins for Wemos D1
```

Tools:

```
Soldering iron
Solder
Wire strippers
```

### Deconstruct Cotcha

If you have a complete Cotcha, you first need to deconstruct it into its base pieces before you can begin.  You
can start with removing the battery.  

**WARNING**: Be careful not to touch the wires of the battery together as it will short it out and could
cause the battery to burst into flames.

You will also need to remove the ground and power wires going from the LiPo charger to the Wemos.
