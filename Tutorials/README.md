# Badge Pirates DC26 Badge Tutorials

Our badge (while blingy) is designed for hacking.  The add-on development board gives you access to the pins
of the ESP32 MCU as well as power.  The idea is for you to take and extend the badge to do something even more
interesting.

## Examples

We are providing several tutorials and examples for different hacks that we have done using the badge.  These
should give you a good starting point to build on and make it yours!

### LiPo Battery Extension

The stock badge comes with a 2x AAA battery holder which will power the badge for about 8 hours of full
bling.  If you want to turn on the wireless features, it draws down the battery much quicker.  @fg has
done a hack to add a LiPo and charger to his badge to give you an idea of how to do this.

### Cotcha Stand Alone Badge

Maybe you didn't buy a badge and got just a DEV board, or want to build a badge of your own.  @networkgeek took
the components from a SECKC Cotcha designed by @billswearingen and made a completely stand alone badge.
